how to display the multi level config <- make it only one level
reduce height
v semi auto populate based on data


==============================

v dimensions should be available after mount and update, now it's only available after animation
v split position and dimensions so only one needs to be updated

New resolver
v resolve overlap, using width and height

v reactivate drag

v Animation to grid
v Drag and zoom spread view

trigger layout resolver only when necessary
	items change
	items' size changed
	v end drag
	pause drag (don't move the dragged one)

v Save position


v reactivate connector drawer
v Connection end

	change background on extreme zooms if needed

------------------------------------

Spawn with calculated position
	- if aligned
		- assign to alignment group(s)
		- resolve sorts
		- then resolve aligns
		- resolve overlap in alignment groups one by one, while moving with the other group
	- combine all the forces

animate
	- if algined in one axis, only move in the other axis
	- aligned groups "move" in aligned axis (average of all members)
	- others move freely while repelling items in radius

end
	- de-overlap
	- snap to grid

	forces
		v prevent overlap only when others are done

		save itemPositions to store

		gradient

		problems
			chasing
			locked / entangled
			unknown forces
			uncentered result
			balancing force strengths
			slow

		ideas
			add range (defaults to [infinity, infinity])
			snap to grid
			get next from displayed properties first
			calculate starting placement
			force texts
			more complicated timed phases:
				rules + gradient distance,
				expand + random + no overlap + to left & below of Spreadport,
				repeat
			more complicated timed phases:
				rules,
				expand + random + no overlap,
				rules,
				all + contract + center,
				manual repeat
			+manual drag 
			saved coords per Spread

	props connector
		v activeEntities -> refresh elements + redraw lines
		- pick connection placement
		- calculate edge placement
			- refactor
			- also for target
		
		v design with start and end
		v itemPositions -> redraw lines
		- Spread config -> redraw lines
		
		- dynamic svg size
		- svg follows scroll

	- differentiate between live entities, active entities, and shown/hidden entities

- change included to included in (top down)
	- test with other project
	- create index
